# Landing Page Menu only for Desktop

This is a simple HTML/CSS/JS landing page for the desktop, which uses CSS properties and JS event listeners in combination to create the parallax effect. It can be viewed from [here](https://website-menu.vercel.app).

It is inspired from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUeCNvYY_x4&ab_channel=Hyperplexed) and the comments in it.
